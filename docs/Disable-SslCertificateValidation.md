# Disable-SslCertificateValidation

## SYNOPSIS
Disable Ssl certificate validation for the current session.

## SYNTAX

```
Disable-SslCertificateValidation [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Disable Ssl certificate validation for the current session. Used for accessing systems
that are using self-signed certificates.
This should be avoided if possible.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> $Results = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $URI -Method Get -Headers $headers
Invoke-RestMethod : The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel.
At line:1 char:12
(truncated)...

PS C:\> Disable-SslCertificateValidation
PS C:\> $Results = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $URI -Method Get -Headers $headers
```

In the above example, first a call is made to Invoke-RestMethod where the URI points to a system that is using a self-signed
certificate and the request fails.
After calling Disable-SslCertificateValidation, the first call is repeated and the call succeeds.
